# Buddy Matching
This app contains the [PlayerServer](lib/player_server/player_server.ex) in which the players are stored while looking for matches. 
Additionally, this app contains the [Player struct](lib/players/player.ex) itself, as well as logic for [matching](lib/players/matching.ex) players and parsing them from the front-end's JSON representation.
